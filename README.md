## Overview
Greetings! Welcome to the README for the NWU Tech Trends Project. This document provides a detailed overview of the project's goals, scope, and the usage of the .Net Web API for enhancing data management. The main aim of this project is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of data handling processes by integrating modern technology and API functionalities. Please read on for more information.

## Introduction
The NWU Tech Trends Project focuses on improving the management of data integration activities. This initiative involves creating a .Net Core Web API that connects to a database to efficiently manage telemetry data.

## Branching Strategies to be Used
### Branch Types
### Main Branch
- The `main` branch contains the production-ready code. All changes to this branch are thoroughly tested and reviewed.
### Feature Branches
- For each new feature, bug fix, or enhancement, create a new branch based on `main`. Use descriptive names that reflect the feature or issue being addressed (e.g., feature/user-authentication, bugfix/data-validation).
### Pull Requests
- Once your feature is complete and ready for review, initiate a pull request from your feature branch to main. This process enables code review, discussion, and testing to take place before the final merge.
  
## Project Objectives
### The main objectives of this project are as follows:
Develop a .Net Core Web API that connects to a database, enabling the streamlined management of telemetry data.
Optimize the handling, monitoring, and updating of data entries for improved efficiency.
Empower stakeholders with instant access to real-time updates on data processing and integration details.

## Specialization
NWU Tech Trends specializes in software development with a focus on Data Integration, GenAI (Generative Artificial Intelligence), and Automation. As a trusted advisor and provider in cutting-edge technologies, NWU Tech Trends offers innovative solutions to help businesses leverage the power of these advanced technologies. They work closely with clients to understand their specific needs and challenges, providing tailored recommendations and implementations.

## Technology Integration
NWU Tech Trends recognizes the importance of technology in modern business processes. By integrating APIs and utilizing cloud-based services, the firm aims to streamline operations and offer a seamless experience to customers. APIs play a crucial role in connecting various components of business ecosystems.

## API Integration
.Net Core Web API provides an effective way to transport data between systems, interfaces, and applications. In this project, the NWU Tech Trends Data Management System will be implemented as a set of APIs, allowing for efficient interaction with the database and data sources.

## .Net Core Web API
The heart of this project is the .Net Core Web API. It includes the following endpoints:
### GET Endpoint
GET: Retrieve telemetry data, including status and tracking information.
### POST Endpoint
POST: Create new data entries and add them to the database.
### PATCH Endpoint
PATCH: Update data information, such as processing status.
### DELETE Endpoint
DELETE: Remove data entries from the database.

## How to Use This Project
